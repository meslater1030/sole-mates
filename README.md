# sole-mates

This is an application to match people who need just one shoe or different sized shoes to their opposite.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies with `go get .`
1. Build the API binary with `go build .` this will output a binary called `service`
1. Run the service with `./service`. You can now access the API at `localhost:3000`
